# Title: City Bike Locator


# Description of your project

Over the years, cities have had bike location issues. These issues mostly arise among travelers travelling interstate or nationally. However, with the increasing popularity of bike systems being used nowadays, the need for an effective userfriendly bike find locator is neccesary. So, this program is designed to mitigate this issue by providing users with real-time bike information, availability, location, and other enhancing trackers. 

This project addreeses the problem of people having bike location issues as mentioned earlier. This may result from users not  being able to understand the language spoken or the means of travel that are typically used (bus, train, taxi,etc.) However, bikes are a very easy way for quick transport. We are aiming to solve the problem of travel
miscommunication by providing users with easy transport via bike. We'll acheive this goal by performing the following specifications:
This Project will contain a Readme, Developer Manual, Front and Backend technologies providing soultions to the city bike location problem.

#Target Population
The general public cares the most about this problem, as they are the ones who are being
affected by this problem. Thousands of people each day travel to new cities whether it is for a
vacation, work, or personal reasons. When in a new city, it can be hard to figure out how to go
from location to location, and very frustrating especially when on a time crunch. Stakeholders
will also care about the problem because they have a stake in the project. Additionally, our
stakeholders will likely already be part of the transportation industry, so they will want to improve
upon its current state.

#System Description
The information problem at hand is not knowing how to get to the closest bike which is used as
a means of easy transportation. Our system solves this issue all in one application. It will solve
the lack of knowledge among the public by showing users where they currently are, what
transportation is near them (bikes), directions to the closest one, how to operate it, and how
much it will cost them. This is the easiest way to provide users with all the information they need
to get from one place to another within the same city. The problem would be solved as users will
know exactly how to get to the closest bike for transportation, how much it will cost them, how to
use it, and how much time it will take them. This makes it much easier for people to navigate
large cities when they are not familiar with the layout.
